# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
## What is Requirement Analysis?  

**Requirement Analysis** is a crucial phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. Its main purpose is to ensure that both the development team and stakeholders have a clear understanding of *what the software should do* before moving forward with design and implementation.  

### Types of Requirements  
- **Functional Requirements** → Define what the system should do (e.g., user login, product search, payment processing).  
- **Non-Functional Requirements** → Define how the system should perform (e.g., speed, security, reliability, scalability).  

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC  
1. **Clarity and Understanding** – Ensures developers and stakeholders share the same vision of the system.  
2. **Prevents Miscommunication** – Reduces the risk of building the wrong product or missing essential features.  
3. **Cost and Time Efficiency** – Identifies and resolves requirement issues early, saving time and resources later.  
4. **Foundation for Design and Development** – Provides a roadmap that guides software design, coding, and testing.  
5. **Stakeholder Satisfaction** – Ensures the final product aligns with user needs and business objectives.  

In summary, Requirement Analysis bridges the gap between **what users need** and **what developers build**, making it one of the most important steps in creating successful software projects.
